            Version control is about (well as the name states) controlling which version you are working on in a certain
            document/file.
            Version control is an improved and more secure way of keeping up to date on which file is the latest, which
            one was edited, which on was pulbished etc.

                Git:
                <ul>
                    <li>Git is a version control system.</li>
                    <li>Everything other version control systems are good at, git is better. In the sense that it has
                        very very good performance</li>
                    <li>Git has both a local and a cloud repository, meaning you can store your files both locally and
                        in the cloud. You can also work from either and then commit -> push it to the master branch. </li>
                </ul>

                Github:
                <ul>
                    <li>Github is another version control system.</li>
                    <li>You can look at Github as "git made easy". In other words you can use github more easily, and its more of a social platform than only version control like git.</li>
                    <li>Github has both a local and a cloud repository, which again means that working from either is entirely possible, and you can also push/commit etc. </li>
